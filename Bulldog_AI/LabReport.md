Using Github Copilot latest version (GPT 4.0) - from Github Education

## Session 1 - Goal of session: create the four classes needed.
2/3/25  9AM-10AM
Session Transcript: 

### ME:
 This is the Player class. Explain what it does. *(highlighting the Player class)*

### COPILOT: 
 The Player class is an abstract class that represents a generic player in a game called Bulldog. Here's a breakdown of its components:

 Fields:

 name: A String that stores the name of the player.
 score: An int that stores the score earned by the player during the game.
 Constructor:

Player(String name): Initializes a new Player object with the given name and sets the initial score to 0.
Methods:

getName(): Returns the name of the player.
getScore(): Returns the current score of the player.
setScore(int score): Sets the current score of the player to the given value.
play(): An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It encapsulates one turn for the player and returns the score earned on that turn. The score will be zero if a six was rolled.
Since Player is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, other classes must extend Player and provide an implementation for the play() method.

### ME: 
This is the WimpPlayer class. Explain what it does. (highlighting WimpPlayer code)

### COPILOT 
*Similar response to above - not recorded.*

### ME: 
Using what you know about the WimpPlayer and Player java files, create a new RandomPlayer file. On RandomPlayer turn, it will randomly (50/50) decide whether to roll or end the turn.

### COPILOT: 
Here's the implementation of the RandomPlayer class, which extends the Player class. On each turn, the RandomPlayer will randomly decide whether to roll the die or end the turn.

This RandomPlayer class:

Has two constructors: a default constructor that names the player "Random" and another that accepts a custom name.
Implements the play() method, where the player rolls the die and randomly decides whether to continue rolling or end the turn. If a 6 is rolled, the score for the turn is set to 0, and the turn ends.

### ME
Great job. Please note that the author is changed to Wyatt McCurdy - and also please add a disclaimer under my name that the code was generated by GPT 4o

### COPILOT
*Responds and makes changes.*

### ME 
Excellent, now please create FifteenPlayer. On FifteenPlayer turn, it always rolls up until it gets to fifteen points.

### COPILOT
Here's the implementation of the FifteenPlayer class, which extends the Player class. On each turn, the FifteenPlayer will continue rolling the die until the total score for the turn reaches or exceeds fifteen points.

### ME
That's great. Now please write the code for HumanPlayer. HumanPlayer allows the human to drive, deciding whether to take the turn using keyboard input "y/n"

### COPILOT
Here's the implementation of the HumanPlayer class, which extends the Player class. The HumanPlayer allows the human to decide whether to continue rolling or end the turn using keyboard input ("y" for yes, "n" for no).

### ME
Thanks! One final player. UniquePlayerGPT uses a unique strategy that you will come up with yourself. Do whatever you think will provide the most consistent winning strategy for the game.

### COPILOT 
Here's the implementation of the UniquePlayerGPT class, which extends the Player class. The UniquePlayer uses a strategy where it rolls the die until it reaches a score of 10 or more, but stops immediately if it rolls a 4 or higher. This strategy aims to balance the risk of rolling a 6 (which resets the score to 0) with the goal of achieving a moderate score each turn.

### ME
Please write the class BulldogGame, where the user selects two players to play against each-other. The game goes until one of the players gets 104 points, at which point the winner is announced and the user is asked if they would like to play again.

### COPILOT
Here's the implementation of the BulldogGame class, which allows the user to select two players to play against each other. The game continues until one of the players reaches 104 points, at which point the winner is announced and the user is asked if they would like to play again.
