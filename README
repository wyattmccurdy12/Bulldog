# Bulldog -- The Game

## Overview
Bulldog is a turn-based dice game where players compete to reach a score of 104 points. The game involves rolling a six-sided die and accumulating points based on the outcome of each roll.

## Rules
1. Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.
2. On each turn, the player rolls the die and adds the rolled number to their turn score.
3. If a player rolls a six, their turn score reverts to zero and their turn ends immediately.
4. If the player rolls any number other than six, the rolled number is added to their turn score.
5. The turn score is then added to the player's total score.
6. The game ends when a player's total score reaches or exceeds 104 points.

## Implementation
The game was implemented in two phases:
1. **Human Implementation**: The initial version of the game was written by a human developer.
2. **AI Implementation**: The game was then re-implemented by an AI to compare the differences between the two versions.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and select two player implementations
2. Let the players go, or take turns with the text interface if you are the human player. 
3. Win or lose, it's fun for the whole family!

Enjoy playing Bulldog!
